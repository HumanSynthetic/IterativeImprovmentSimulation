# Define initial scenario

Background:
This planet's resources have dwindled to critical levels due to the natural passage of time. Amidst this, a possible energy source has been discovered deep within the ruins of an ancient city, known as "The Nexus." This energy source has the potential to solve your organizationâ€™s energy crisis and get your organization off world, but it is limited and can only sustain a single organization.

Objective:
You are one of two powerful organizations setting your sights on The Nexus. Your mission is to capture and secure this vital energy source, ensuring your survival. Due to the scarcity of the resource, collaboration or sharing is not an option. You must succeed or be no more.
